            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>The CASE of the Petitioners touching the Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Sheriffs for the City of <hi>London.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THE Citizens of <hi>London</hi> in Common-Hall assembled, have had, us'd, and enjoy'd the Liberty (by Prescription and immemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Usage) from time to time freely to elect and appoint their Sheriffs from among themselves; which Liberty hath been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by the Great Charter of Liberties, and many other Charters and Acts of Parliament, the last whereof was in the second Year of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent King and late Queen, wherein it is declared, That the restoring the Citizens to their Antient Liberties tends very much to the Peace and good Settlement of this Kingdom.</p>
            <p>Notwithstanding which, the Court of Aldermen for some Years last past (for the Lucre of Fines) have discharged those from the Shrievalty, (tho every way qualified) who were legally and duly chosen by the Citizens in Common-Hall; and have caused new and partial Elections to be carried on and multiplied by an inferior number of the Common-Hall, while the major Part have adhered to their due and former Election;</p>
            <p>To the unreasonable Trouble and great Disquiet of the Citizens, who have again been summoned to ten or more irregular Common-Halls, where have been made (as they humbly hope to make appear) rather forced and pretended, than free Elections, of 15 or more Sheriffs, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by above 5000 <hi>l.</hi> have been raised by Fines in one Year for their Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge.</p>
            <p>And these sort of Elections have lasted for near three Months together: which doings, if still suffer'd, ('tis humbly feared) may tend to the hazard of the Peace of the City and Kingdom, and may have evil and dangerous Consequences in the Example, to the encouraging corrupt and sinister Practices in placing other City Officers.</p>
            <p>By this Practice of the Court of Aldermen in discharging of Sheriffs against the Consent of the Electors, the Right of the Citizens to make a free Election (according to their Prescription, Usage, and Charters confirm'd as aforesaid) is become void and of no effect, and (as they humbly conceive) wholly taken from them, and they render'd thereby unsafe in their Lives, Liberties and Estates.</p>
            <p>The Power of the Sheriffs is well known, and what Service or Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>service they may do the Publick upon emergent Occasions, according as they stand affected, especially the Sheriffs of <hi>London;</hi> where the perverting the antient manner of their Election in the late Reigns was attended with very mischievous Consequences still fresh in Memory.</p>
            <p>The placing this great Trust in about 8000 of the most grave and wealthy Citizens, which is the Number of the Common-Hall, rather than in the Court of Aldermen that are but 26, (who are also Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Common-Hall, and <hi>Co-Electors</hi> there, and whereof thirteen do make a Court) sufficiently shews the Wisdom of our Ancestors, who judg'd that these last, being so small a Number, might sooner be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluenced than the former; seven or eight of which Court have often discharg'd Sheriffs duly elected by the Common-Hall: Tho it seems con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Reason and the Method of Elections, that seven or eight <hi>Co-Electors</hi> should undo what themselves have done in Conjunction with so many thousand others.</p>
            <p>Wherefore it is humbly hoped that the Honourable House of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, will in their great Wisdom find out a Remedy to redress these Grievances, and settle the Election of the aforesaid Sheriffs in such man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as may be most safe and beneficial for the City and Kingdom.</p>
